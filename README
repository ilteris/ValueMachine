Value Machine is an interactive visualisation project which focuses on ‘conversations’ happening in the blogosphere and attempts to reveal the hypothetical economic values of these conversations. We produce, consume and share our knowledge with each other every day on blogs. Lately, this vast amount of exchange has begun to extend itself from the source of the information and spread out to different channels raising the question of ownership. Who does own the knowledge? Can we talk about a value system to quantify this knowledge? Can we monetise this knowledge? The aim of the project is to point out the new directions of conversations on the web and the new economy that establishes itself around these conversations.   Value Machine consists of an application interface that discovers and analyses real-time activity of user defined conversations. Calculated values are sent to the printer which then prints out the results of the analysis for each conversation. The printed receipts are aimed to give the users the idea of the value that exists in cyber space.
